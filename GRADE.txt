Team Points:
  20/20 points for a working platformer with a filled out README
  15/20 points for having enough sizable changes (4 changes if in a group of 1, 5 changes if in a group of 2, 6 changes if in a group of 3, 8 changes if in a group of 4)
  -double jump
  -sprint
  -reset
  -pause works, but I had to assign it to a node first
  -fire is there, but isn't working because your killzones seem to be broken

  -I don't see flying enemies, and jump_slime is the same as slime. Jump boost doesn't work because jump_velocity deson't match JUMP_VELOCITY, which is also a constant.

  8/10 points for following the PR process correctly, including reviewing your teammates’ code (not required for solo projects, instead points will come from having enough changes)
