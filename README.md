## Reflections
This project was in retrospect not so difficult, but while it was going on it seemed hard. It was tough to learn GitHub and to be able to sift through and make sense of all the code in our project.
We made some substantial changes, and we tried our best to resolve issues when doing pull requests. GitHub manages these things well, but it is not a very intuitive site.
